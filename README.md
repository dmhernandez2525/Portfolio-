# Daniel's Portfolio

> A portfolio website that got slightly out of hand. What started as "I should probably have a website" turned into a 3D globe, 8 playable games, 16 Easter eggs, and enough animations to make your GPU question its life choices.

## What Is This?

This is my personal portfolio—a React-powered showcase of 23 projects spanning AI/ML platforms, SaaS applications, native macOS apps, hardware projects, and yes, a POS system for a lemonade stand (it's a long story).

**Live at:** [Coming Soon to a Domain Near You]

## The Highlights

### 23 Projects, 15 Live Demos
Not just screenshots and lorem ipsum. Real, deployed applications you can actually click on and use. Revolutionary concept, I know.

**Flagship Projects:**
- **CodeReview AI** — Self-hosted AI code reviews with zero data retention. Because your code is your business.
- **Patent Intelligence** — Semantic search across 200M+ patents. Find that expiring patent before your competitors do.
- **VoiceForge** — Clone any voice in 3 seconds. Entirely local. Your data never leaves your machine (unlike that one ex).
- **Jarvis** — A fully local voice assistant running 72B parameter models. Alexa, but it respects your privacy.

### 7 Playable Games
Because what's a portfolio without a Chess AI that will humble you? Also includes Tetris, Snake, Cookie Clicker (productivity killer), and an Agar.io clone.

### 16+ Easter Eggs
Try the Konami Code. Or don't. I'm not your mom.

### Interactive 3D Globe
Built with Cesium.js because a flat map of my career journey felt too... flat.

## Tech Stack

The "I wanted to try everything" starter pack:

- **React 19** + **TypeScript 5.9** — Because `any` is not a type, it's a cry for help
- **Vite 7** — Fast builds or bust
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — Utility classes go brrr
- **Framer Motion** — For animations that don't make users nauseous
- **Three.js** + **Cesium.js** — 3D things that hopefully impress someone
- **GSAP** — When Framer Motion isn't extra enough
- **Radix UI** — Accessible components because not everyone uses a mouse

## Project Tiers

I organized my projects into tiers because I have opinions:

| Tier | What It Means | Count |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Flagship** | Enterprise-grade, would stake my reputation on | 6 |
| **Strong** | Production-ready, actively maintained | 11 |
| **Supporting** | Useful tools, experiments, "it works on my machine" | 6 |

## Features That Took Way Too Long

- **Tier Filtering** — Filter projects by how proud I am of them
- **Category Icons** — Visual indicators so you don't have to read
- **Status Badges** — Live, Active, Beta, or "I'll finish this someday"
- **Responsive Grid** — Works on mobile, tablet, and that ultrawide monitor you definitely needed
- **Animated Transitions** — Because static content is for printed resumes

## Easter Eggs Hints

I'm not going to tell you where they all are (that defeats the purpose), but:
- Classic gaming codes work here
- Try typing certain words
- Some things respond to specific mouse patterns
- The console might have something to say

## Why This Exists

I needed a portfolio. I could have used a template. Instead, I spent way too much time making a Chess AI, hiding secrets in the codebase, and rendering a 3D globe.

No regrets. Okay, maybe some regrets.

## The Philosophy

> "If you're going to build a portfolio, you might as well have fun with it."
> — Me, justifying feature creep
