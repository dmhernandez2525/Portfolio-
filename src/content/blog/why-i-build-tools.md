## Products Solve One Path, Tools Multiply Paths

A product serves a user flow. A tool enables many user flows, including ones you cannot predict ahead of time. That leverage is why I spend more time building reusable systems.

### What Changed My Approach

I used to optimize for a single polished outcome. Over time, I saw more long-term value in creating composable building blocks that other teams could adapt.

### Tool Design Principles

- Prefer clear interfaces over clever internal tricks.
- Make defaults safe and predictable.
- Keep extension points explicit.
- Document failure modes, not only happy paths.

## Compounding Effect

A strong tool can be reused, remixed, and improved by others. That compounding curve is hard to match with one-off products.
