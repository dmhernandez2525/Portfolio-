## Start Where You Are

I started in tech without a degree, without industry connections, and without extra time. I had family responsibilities and a clear goal: become useful enough that people would pay for the outcomes I could deliver.

### Build in Public

Shipping imperfect work taught me faster than private practice ever could. Every project forced me to learn design tradeoffs, debugging patterns, and client communication under real pressure.

### Focus on Problems, Not Trends

Frameworks shift. Customer problems stay. The strongest growth came from solving painful, repeated business problems and measuring whether those solutions actually worked.

### Keep a Proof Log

A self-taught path needs evidence. I tracked screenshots, before and after metrics, and testimonials so each project became proof of capability.

## Practical 30-Day Plan

1. Pick one painful problem that affects real users.
2. Ship a tiny solution with clear success metrics.
3. Write a postmortem with what worked, what failed, and what changed.
4. Share the project publicly and ask for direct feedback.

The path is not glamorous, but it compounds. Focus on useful output, iterate fast, and let results speak for you.
